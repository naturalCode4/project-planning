Description:
-An application where users can get concert recommendations based on customized preferences/filters

Features:
-Filters including location, date, and musical taste -- like genre, energy-level, acoustic vs electronic, popularity, that generates concerts based on this.
-Awesome interface for users to set filters (custom sliders and such)
-Utilizes spotify's Get Recommendations API and a concert website's API. (This project idea needs more exploration. I need to see what API technologies are available to see if this is possible)
-Gives links to tickets

Pages:
-Log in
-Main, where users 
-Saved concerts/user's calendar


Future features:
-Users can save ("favorite") concerts they are interested in to folder(s). I really want this to be part of it
-A login feature with this
-10 tracks by the artist (if they exist) show up with concert recommendations
-^That favorites folder is actually a calendar
-Links to the other website I made, or its built in.
