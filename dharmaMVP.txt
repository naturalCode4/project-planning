Description:
-A website with curated resources I think are awesome Muahahahaha! Particularly dharma-related resources.
-Resources include exercises, books, youtube videos, monasteries, people to know, quotes

Features:
-Home page explaining what is happening
-Drop down menu for sections. Such as:
buddhism, yoga, health/well-being, taoism, therapy, men's work, women's work,inner child work,, mental health resources, dreamwork etc.
-Each section is designed and has links, descriptions, and photos for resources
-Users can star/unstar (or check, save, whatever) what they want to listen to. Can leave comments/journal entries about it
-Therefore login feature to view their saves and journals and comments

Pages:
-Main
-For each section
-User's Favorites Page / Journal
-Contact creator (me!) for recommendations or generally getting-in-touch

Future Features:
-Search bar by keyword
-Users can share to social media pages (or at least one)
-Page for users to send recommended dharma resources by email for the site (for my approval)
-There's a page where users can write their goals, track meditation, make notes, etc. (or link mindfulspace.org by Haytham Hakim)

Note:
-The other route to go with this is an open-source resource for anyone to post on. I honestly dont trust it that much. I may set that up so I have to approve everything that comes in
